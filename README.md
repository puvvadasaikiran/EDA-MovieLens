# EDA-MovieLens

MovieLens data sets were collected by the GroupLens Research Project
at the University of Minnesota.
 
This data set consists of:

	100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies.
	Each user has rated at least 20 movies.
    Simple demographic info for the users (age, gender, occupation, zip)
    

The data was collected through the MovieLens web site
(movielens.umn.edu) during the seven-month period from September 19th, 
1997 through April 22nd, 1998. This data has been cleaned up - users
who had less than 20 ratings or did not have complete demographic
information were removed from this data set.


This is EDA done for Experimentational and Educational Purpose
